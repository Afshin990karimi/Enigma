Enigma Machine Simulator in Python

This Python project simulates the functionality of the Enigma machine, a complex electro-mechanical cipher machine developed in the 1920s and used extensively during World War II. The Enigma machine was notoriously difficult to crack, and this simulator allows users to experiment with its inner workings and understand the principles of encryption and decryption.
Features

    Accurate simulation: This project accurately models the Enigma machine's rotor system, plugboard, and reflector, ensuring that the encryption and decryption processes are faithful to the original machine.
    User -friendly interface: The simulator provides an intuitive interface for users to input plaintext, set machine configurations, and observe the encryption and decryption processes.
    Educational value: This project serves as a valuable educational tool for students and enthusiasts of cryptography, computer science, and history, offering a unique opportunity to explore the intricacies of the Enigma machine.

Getting started

To use this simulator, simply:

    Clone the repository
    Install the required dependencies
    Run the Python script

You can then input your plaintext and experiment with different machine settings to see how the Enigma machine encrypts and decrypts your messages.
